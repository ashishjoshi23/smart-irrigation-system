# Smart Irrigation System - Project Summary

## Overview
An IoT-based automated irrigation system that uses soil moisture, temperature, and rain sensors to control a water pump, reducing water waste and improving crop health. Notifications are sent to farmers via GSM.

## Key Features
- Automated watering based on soil moisture and temperature
- Rain detection to prevent unnecessary watering
- Real-time SMS alerts to farmer's mobile
- LCD display for system status
- Energy efficient design

## Components Used
- Raspberry Pi 3 (Controller)
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Rain Sensor
- DC Motor (Water Pump)
- GSM Module for alerts
- 16x2 LCD Display

## Working Principle
1. Sensors continuously monitor environment
2. If temperature > 25°C AND moisture < 100 → Motor ON
3. If rain detected → Motor OFF
4. SMS alerts sent for all state changes
5. LCD displays real-time parameters
